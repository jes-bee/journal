        <p><strong>FAQ</h1></strong></p>
        
       

            <p><strong>What is the purpose of journaling?</strong><br>
            Journaling helps you process emotions, set goals, boost creativity, and improve mental health. It’s a personal space for self-reflection and growth.</p>
            
            <p><strong>How do I use the journaling prompt generator?</strong><br>
            Simply click on the “Generate Prompt” button, and a new journaling prompt will appear. You can use it as inspiration to write in your journal.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What are some benefits of using journaling prompts?</strong><br>
            Prompts provide a starting point when you feel stuck or unsure of what to write. They help you explore new topics, spark creativity, and keep your journaling practice fresh.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Can I get daily prompts sent to my email?</strong><br>
            Yes! Sign up for my email list on the <a href="./index.html">home page</a>, and we’ll send you a new journaling prompt every day, perfect for staying consistent with your journaling.</p>
            
            <p><strong>What types of prompts do you offer?</strong><br>
            I am building my library of prompts related to creativity, self-care, mental health, goal setting, and personal growth. Each prompt is designed to encourage reflection and self-discovery.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Can I request a new category of journaling prompts?</strong><br>
            Absolutely! I love hearing from visitors here! If you have an idea for a new category of prompts, feel free to contact me through the <a href="./contact.html">contact form</a>. I always look out for new ideas, whether it’s prompts for mindfulness, gratitude, creativity, or something entirely unique!</p> 

            <p><strong>Is journaling good for mental health?</strong><br>
            Absolutely. Journaling can reduce stress, manage anxiety, and improve mood. It’s a great way to express thoughts and feelings in a safe, private space.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Do I need to write every day?</strong><br>
            Not necessarily. While daily journaling can be beneficial, the most important thing is consistency. Write as often as feels comfortable for you.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Can I use journaling for goal setting?</strong><br>
            Yes! Journaling is an excellent tool for setting and tracking personal goals. You can explore your motivations, create actionable steps, and reflect on progress.</p>
            
            <p><strong>Do I need any special tools to journal?</strong><br>
            All you need is a notebook or digital device and something to write with. The prompt generator works on any device with internet access.</p>
            
            <p><strong>How do I overcome writer's block in journaling?</strong><br>
            Using prompts is one of the best ways to combat writer’s block. You can also try writing freely without worrying about grammar or structure—just let your thoughts flow.</p>
